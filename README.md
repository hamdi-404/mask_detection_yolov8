# Real-Time Face Mask Detection Using YOLOv8 😷🎯

This project detects whether a person is:
- Wearing a mask correctly 😷
- Wearing a mask incorrectly 😕
- Not wearing a mask at all 😐

The detection runs in **real-time using your webcam** and is powered by **YOLOv8** from Ultralytics.

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Make sure your webcam is connected.
2. Run the real-time detection:

```bash
python detect_webcam.py
```

## 📊 Training Summary

- **Model**: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- **Classes**:
  - `with_mask`
  - `without_mask`
  - `incorrect_mask`
- **Dataset**: Custom-labeled dataset in YOLO format
- **Training**: Fine-tuned with augmentation & validation monitoring
- **Performance**: Trained model saved as `best.pt`

## 🎥 Demo

> Upload your webcam demo as `demo_video.mp4` or `.gif`, and embed it here if sharing on GitHub.
